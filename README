##Notes##

- installed a plugin to remove category base, this makes /resources/{category}/{sub-category} urls possible
  - should look at incorporating this into the theme since upgrading the plugin could break our urls
- reorganize code in functions.php

##TODO##

- add theme support for post formats
  - This would be good for our blog to have a more tumblr like functionality since we have many short posts
  - anthing that's a link, video, single image, status could all just be displayed on the index, longer posts could have a jump to single page
- fix styling for width on people so that it's not dependant on description length. 
  - article.person { width: 963px; margin-left:-4px; }
  - also need to fix width of thumbnail
